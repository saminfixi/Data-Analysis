üçï Pizza Sales Analysis Dashboard 

This repository contains a dynamic and interactive Tableau dashboard designed to provide comprehensive insights into pizza sales data. The project aims to uncover key trends, popular products, and sales performance metrics to support strategic business decisions. 

 

üöÄ Project Overview 

This Tableau workbook offers an intuitive way to explore various aspects of pizza sales. By visualizing critical sales metrics, it helps answer questions like: 

What are our total sales and order volumes? 

Which pizza types and sizes are most popular? 

How do sales trends vary daily, weekly, or monthly? 

What are the busiest times for sales? 

Which categories contribute most to revenue? 

This dashboard is a valuable tool for understanding sales performance, optimizing menu offerings, and identifying opportunities for growth in the pizza business.
